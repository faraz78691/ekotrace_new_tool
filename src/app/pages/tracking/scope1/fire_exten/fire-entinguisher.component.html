                            fuels in stationary sources are a significant part of an
                            organization’s overall carbon footprint due to the widespread
                            use of liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil,
                            kerosene, and others.

                            butane, and other similar gases used for heating, power

                            or animals that can be used as fuel. This includes wood,
                            agricultural residues, animal waste, and dedicated energy crops.
